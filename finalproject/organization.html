                    <h2>Order on a Webpage</h2>
                    <p>This is where we return to the principle of using containers, but also focus on putting content together that complements each other. For instance if you were to have
                        an e-commerce web page and were advertising a product there would be no point to have the description of another product by that item's photo. It is also important to
                        have order in the since that content is in understandable locations. For instance you wouldn't want a conclusion at the beginning of a paper, but would want it at the
                        end. This is why using containers can be so useful. They can help you make sure all your content is exactly where you want it and in many instances how much space the
                        stuff will take up.

                    <h2>Following a pattern or outline</h2>
                    <p>There are many patterns all around us. We just have to recognize them. In fact there are even patterns in websites and how they are organized. For instance here are
                        some wireframes that were used to help keep this very website organized. Although not every wireframe has to be followed to the letter but can act as a guideline
                        instead.

                    <h2>Using Images</h2>
                    <p>Using images can help make more sense about what is being shared. It is just like the saying goes a picture is woth a thousand words. Wether explaining steps about 
                        something or showing somethng off pictures can help show someone exactly what you are talking about. You do need to be careful however. When inserting an image it is
                        important to consider the size of the image. If you are just showing a quck concept it is in reasonable to have the image be a few thousand pixels by a few thousand
                        pixels.

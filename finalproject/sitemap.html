                    <ul>
                        <li>Good and bad fonts to use</li>
                        <li>Color matching</li>

                    <p>When putting a website together it is always important to make sure the visitor
                        of the page is able to read the content on it. You can do this by verifying the 
                        the font is easy to understand, no crazy wierd loops and swerls. Another thing
                        that can be used is the use of color. When changing the color of the background
                        or maybe the font it is important that the colors dont clash in unwated ways. An
                        exxample of this can be the use of two similar colors side by side or even on top
                        of each other. Then for the headers, those come in useful to identify diffrent new 
                        sections of content and not just make the words bigger.

                    <ul>

                        <li>following a pattern so each page is consistant</li>
                        <li>using images with your layout</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The flow of a webpage is key. Not having everything just stacked on top of everything
                        else can create a sense of order and help direct people's atention. It is also 
                        important to follow a pattern. This is useful to help people more easily identify the content
                        they are looking for, and navigate your website. Then the use of images can quite honestly 
                        help the viewer see what you are wanting to share with them. Images can also help in a 
                        variety of other areasa such as what a product looks like or how a finished product should 
                        appear.

                        <li>Keeping HTML orderly (using divs) and other organizeational tags</li>

                    <p>Now for the stuff that the viewer may not see in the everyday use of your webpage. You should
                        Always keep your HTML orderly. This can be done in a handful of ways first being the tags we 
                        use. Using the header, main, section, and footer tags can help identify which section of code
                        does what. You can also use notes and or classess to identify what certain sections or for such
                        as identifying where the links are in the footer or which section contains the list of products
                        you are trying to sell. Many times when dealing with CSS, there are multiple ways of doing one 
                        thing. So when dealing with it it is important to make sure we are using atributes that most 
                        efficiently acomplish our goals and not overlapping styles that are not needed or required.
                        Then, finaly, organizing the list of styles that have been applied. when putting the styles 
                        together it can be a big help to keep them orderly in such a way, so that if a change is needed
                        or an error occurs you are able to find what needs to be fixed instead of scrolling around for
                        hours.

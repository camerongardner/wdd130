        <p><strong>Hello</strong> and welcome to my webpage. I generally don't have a whole
            lot to say, <em>but when I do</em> say something or write something down,
            I like to have a purpose for doing so. I find that when there is purpose it
            makes more sense to have it written and/or have a need to have it said. That doesn’t mean mistakes
            won’t be made, but it does mean I like to do my best and not waste time. Then to go off topic here
            is a list of some of the activities I do enjoy.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boardgames</li>
            <li>Card Games</li>
            <li>Puzzle Games</li>
            <li>Ham Radio</li>
            <li>Movies and other videos</li>

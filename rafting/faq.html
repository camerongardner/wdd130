                    <p>If there happens to be problems on the trip such as bad weather or medical emergency
                        we will have an emergency response plan. This plan will consist of getting to shore, 
                        assessing the issues, then act appropriately. If there happens to be bad weather we 
                        will make it back to shore and wait in a complimentary van. If bad weather persists
                        appropriate arrangements will be made for refunds and other such accommodations.
                        If there is a medical emergency the guide will give appropriate directions to
                        resolve the emergency to the best that can be done.

                <h2>Why White Water Rafting</h2>
                <p>White water rafting is a fun activity for all ages, though we recommend the age
                    of 8. This is a simple activity that all can be apart of. White water rafting
                    provides a thrilling adventure that will be remembered for a lifetime. It is a 
                    great way to enjoy nature and cool off in the blistering heat that summer brings.
                    Rafting can also provide family bonding and strengthening experiences, by working
                    together.
